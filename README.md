# SolidWorks-Designs

**1) The cam mount bracket**


_The design was done by me for a Project which was commenced on an IR remote controlled table fan.This cam mount backet was used to hold the motor.Already existed cam mount bracket has to design as the Task.According to the measurements of the bracket,I designed the bracket using SOLIDWORKS.Here is the one of the isometric view of the SOLIDWORKS design and the actual bracket that can be bought from the market._

Here is the actual camera mout bracket.

**2) MINI UPS enclosure**


_This project was done as an indivisual project by me.The task was to implement a marketable electronic product.In production queue,before mass productions,prototyping take place an important place where we Design enclosures,PCBs,etc.Here some of isometric views and the real 3D printed enclosure pictures have been illustrated below_

_**3) Linear Power Supply ( Using Sheet Metal )**_

**Here even the metal net,het sink,scres,etc. all was designed Using SOLIDWORKS**
The enclosure design of the linear power supply is
required to protect users from any potential
electrical hazards. Hence, we ensure that all
exposed metal parts are grounded and that there
are no exposed electrical components.
The linear power supply generates heat during
operation, so the enclosure design is supposed to
dissipate that heat effectively. Therefore,
ventilation (including vents on the side of the
enclosure and holes) is used to ensure that the
components remain cool. This helps to dissipate
the heat generated by the components and prevent
the temperature from rising too high.
The enclosure is required to be large enough to
accommodate all of the components of the power
supply, including the rectifier, and other
components.
Also, the enclosure is designed to allow easy access
to the components for maintenance or repair
purposes by using removable doors.
Considering the above requirements, the enclosure
design was designed using SOLIDWORKS software.
Physically, the enclosure was made using metal.

Here I have used sheet metal In order to build the enclosure with metal
